This is a Compose Multiplatform project that creates a Doom Fire Effect.

HUUUGE thanks to https://linkedin.com/in/adam-bennett-4784b327 for his original Doom Fire Compose Repo:  https://github.com/ditn/Doom-Compose

I've just taken Adam's work (which he did back when Compose was in its infancy), and introduced some newer paradigms.. including Compose Multiplatform.  Now this Doom Fire effect will work on Android and iOS!
